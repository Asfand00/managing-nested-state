Ensured Immutability Nested State:

When updating the nested `address` property, i created a new object for the updated `address` property to achieve immuntability. I used spread syntax to create a shallow copy of the `userProfile` object then i created a new object for the `addres`s property with updated values passed in the `updateAddress` function. This ensures the original state remains unchanged instead of modifying the state directly.

Initialization of the userProfile state using the useState hook also helps as well and using setUserProfile to update the state correctly helps with immutability.
